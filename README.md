## Installation
This app is created with NodeJS and requires Inquirer NPM package. To install the package, run ```npm install``` in your terminal. 
## Usage
Once all of the dependancies are installed, run ```node app.js``` in your terminal. You will then be prompted a series of questions. Once you finish, the HTML file will be created in the output folder. 

## Test
I use JEST to run tests for this app. Once you run ```npm install``` you will be able to run ```npm run test``` to start the test.
